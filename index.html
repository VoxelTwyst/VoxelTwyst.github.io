            Welcome to my portfolio.<br><br>
            I would like to prove to you my fascination with games and everything that surrounds them:
            their history and its consequences; their visual designs, their gameplay, and the technical elements that underpin everything.<br><br><br><br>

            <p>
                Desert Dig is a short, tile-based puzzle game that I made in a week for a game jam. It placed #16 in the Game Design category out of over 700 entries
                from around the world. You play as my attempt at drawing a meerkat in 8x8 pixels (harder than I expected),
                and your aim is to reach the flag in each of the twelve levels without being spotted by an enemy.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can try it out <a href="/desert-dig" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The theme of the jam was "holes". As that was revealed, I started brainstorming ideas.
                My first thought was "rabbit hole". I also considered golf - I thought that some kind of reverse golf might be interesting.
                In the end, I correctly guessed that golf would be quite a popular theme, and stuck with the "rabbit holes" idea, changing the rabbit
                to a meerkat since it's a less obvious choice for a burrowing animal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another idea stuck out to me: that of "digging yourself into a hole". This made me think of puzzle games, and a puzzle game seemed feasible.
                Eventually, I arrived at the final concept: a stealth puzzle with both overground and underground movement, where you can block your own path
                by digging holes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is the concept for one of my favourite levels.
            </p>
            <img class="round" src="img/level-example.png">
            <p>
                I planned each one out in a similar fashion, with arrows showing the correct path through the level:
                red represents underground movement, while green represents overground. P is the player's starting position, F is the flag, E are enemies; B and D
                are a button and a door. I tried to embody the idea of tricking the player into thinking the solution was obvious,
                while it was really something more complex, to create the feeling of satisfaction that is a big part of the genre's appeal.
            </p>
            <p>
                The version you see is not exactly the same as the one I submitted. To prepare it for my portfolio, I responded to some of the feedback that
                I recieved during the jam:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>I gave the rotating enemies red indicator arrows showing where they would turn next, to allow the player to better plan their next move.</li>
                <li>I made the patrolling enemies leave behind some dust when they fall down holes to make it more obvious what happened to them.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I also decided to export the project to HTML5 rather than to a native executable so that you could play it more easily. However, this caused a
                problem: a bug in Game Maker Studio's HTML5 compiler caused flags to check for the player before enemies could, allowing the player to beat level 9
                far more easily than intended by going straight to the flag.
            </p>
            <p>
                To account for this, I made a special flag object that makes sure to prompt all enemies to scan for the player before it lets them win.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, I am satisfied with this project, but if I had more time, I would like to make more levels. The patrolling enemies have potential to be used
                in many more interesting ways, and I would like to fully explore them. Had I had my time again, I would definitely have been less restrictive on myself
                with the graphics: I wanted to make each sprite 8x8 and use only four colours, but that way I struggled to make some objects legible. I particularly
                recieved comments that the flag is hard to see.

            <h1>Depthmap Generation: a programming project</h1>
            <p>
                To test my programming ability, I decided to try and create a depthmap generation program without using machine learning. I thought it would
                be an interesting challenge. In short, the program simulates binocular vision, generating estimated depth values for each pixel in a pair of images.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wrote my code in Python, which turned out to be something of a mistake, since Python is quite slow, and my algorithm has a time complexity
                of O(w&sup2;h), where w is the image's width and h is its height.
                I tried to rewrite it using the CUDA GPU programming framework, which would have made things considerably faster using the graphics card's
                concurrent processing, but my GPU was too old to run it.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can click <a href="https://github.com/VoxelTwyst/VoxelTwyst.github.io/tree/master/depthmapping">here</a> to see my source code.
            </p>
            <p>
                It could definitely do with some work, but I like the concept. Here is an example result, which may not be the best depthmap in the world,
                but it is certainly interesting.
            </p>
            <div class="images">

                <img src="depthmapping/out/office_pixim.png" class="wide">
            </div>
            <p>
                Here's the output with the levels adjusted:
            </p>

                <img src="img/office_contrast.png" class="wide">
            </div>
            <p>
                As you can see, in this simple virtual scene (which I found for free on the unity asset store), the algorithm demonstrates a respectable
                understanding of near and distant objects, singling out the central pillar and the pillar on one side of the door. This example may not be
                the best representation of the real world, since it has many similar colours which could have caused confusion, but it definitely shows promise.

            <h1>A character design project</h1>
            <p>
                I decided to include an example of my digital art and design work to demonstrate the range of my interests that relate to the field of games.
                Digital drawing is one of my hobbies, so while I am not looking for a career focused on art, I would like to show my understanding of
                iterative design techniques that can be applied to games in general.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have created this character for a tabletop RPG campaign that I will be playing in the near future. One of the most important influences on her
                design was the setting: the cyberpunk future of a high fantasy world, where both magic and technology play a key role in society. I had an idea
                for a character who was proficient at manipulating both of these forces, and sought to do what had not been done previously by combining the
                two into a single discipline. I set out to create a visual design for her at the beginning of the story, when she works as an electrical engineer.
            </p>
            <p>
                This led to the key ideas behind her design: she would include motifs of both magic and technology, but at this stage they would be very clearly
                separated to symbolise the divide within her. I thought that a character who is both intelligent and charismatic would be an interesting
                subversion of tropes, and as she is a woman engineer, another contradiction of stereotypes, she should somehow express her femininity through
                her appearance.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started by using Pinterest to collect ideas that inspired me. East Asian street fashion stuck out for its bright colours and interesting twists on
                common items of clothing. I thought that I could incorporate overalls, a common uniform for engineers, but perhaps not in a conventional way:
                she could have worn them differently in an act of self-expression. I also thought of climbing harnesses - not only did I notice some of that kind of
                strong cloth straps in some fashion items I saw; I thought that in a cyberpunk world, an engineer might need a harness to climb up and down
                tall buildings.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I design characters, I sometimes like to look for inspiration in music. For this character, I thought the song <i>Bomb</i> by Alexa
                fit quite well, and its album cover influenced my choice of colour palette.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is my annotated sheet of initial design ideas:
            </p>
            <img src="img/character-initial.png">
            <p>
                You can also see some of my reference images on the right hand side.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also did some separate experimentation with colour palettes:
            </p>
            <img src="img/character-colours.png">
            <p>
                Using these, I created 3 complete concepts to inspire my final design:
            </p>
            <img src="img/character-3.png">
            <p>
                Here are my thoughts on each of them.
            </p>
            <h2>1</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A ponytail makes sense for a person who moves around a lot, and doesn't want their hair to get caught in anything.</li>
                <li>Strong walking-boots, or even steel cap boots, would make sense for the same reason.</li>
                <li>Wearing the overalls on just her legs creates an interesting and distinctive silhouette.</li>
                <li>The harness here doesn't look like it would really do anything.</li>
                <li>I like the shape of the eyes and the fringe reminds me of a lot of the East Asian fashion.</li>
                <li>This isn't really an opinion but she's supposed to be throwing a grenade: my dynamic poses could use some work.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>2</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I honestly like this one the most: the simplicity is quite fitting since she is just setting out. The other options could be more fitting
                    later in the story.
                </li>
                <li>It doesn't really sell the magic part of her design, though. It could use some more magic-themed accessories.</li>
                <li>I like that the belt creates a more feminine silhouette, even though she is wearing the engineer uniform.</li>
                <li>I platform shoes because I saw them in a lot of the references, but I think they are not very practical and she wouldn't wear them.</li>
                <li>It's a shame that this doesn't use the harness idea.</li>
                <li>Her hair being slanted at the back also develops the silhouette and I think it looks cool.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>3</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    With this one, I tried to push the magic thing as far as possible. Her overalls are tied behind her to look like a cape, and she has the
                    makeshift witch hat I came up with in my initial designs.
                </li>
                <li>She looks a bit young: her face should be longer.</li>
                <li>I like the more accurate climbing harness.</li>
                <li>The boots are definitely something. They are sort of superhero-esque, which is not really what I am going for at this stage.</li>
                <li>A button-up shirt is also not very cyberpunk.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Taking all this into consideration, I want these elements for her final design:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>I will use the practical footwear.</li>
                <li>At this stage, she should wear her uniform just about normally to leave room for development.</li>
                <li>I would like to incorporate her magic in the pose of the final piece.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Drumroll please:</p>
            <img src="img/character-final.png">
            <p>
                I think she looks pretty good. Maybe she could do with some more magic-themed accessories, but other than that, I'm happy with her design.
                Next, I have to design her a weapon, which will be quite challenging because I want her to use guns and I have no idea how to draw those.

            <h1>What I'm working on now</h1>
            <p>
                Recently, I've been working on a game that's way outside my comfort zone. It's a 3D mobile game: I am far more comfortable working in 2D,
                both graphicaly and technically, and I have never worked with touch input before. In fact, while I am familiar with the basic operation of
                Unity, which I chose for this project for its useful features and its quick and easy mobile testing, I normally prefer its
                alternatives for their ease of use. It is certainly challenging to learn all these things at once.
            </p>
            <p>
                My inspiration for this game was a misleading mobile game ad. While the game it represented was a generic city builder, the ad presented
                a unique real-time strategy game. Surprisingly, it seemed to have some great ideas about how to find a balance between the simplicity of
                mobile RTS games (such as Clash of Clans's system for attacking other players' villages), and the strategic depth of PC RTSs (Supreme Commander,
                Starcraft, etc.).
            </p>
            <p>
                The nonexistent game seemed to allow the player individual control of each unit, but did not overcomplicate things this way: each unit could
                only attack, and had no special abilities. I was intrigued by the concept of upgrading units by merging them: a common mobile mechanic that
                could replace the upgrade system present in some traditional RTSs.
            </p>
            <p>
                So far, I have managed to prototype the basic controls. I was insipred by the <i>Pikmin</i> series, particularly <i>Pikmin 3</i>'s touchscreen
                controls. They work as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The player can pan and zoom with two fingers, within certain limits.</li>
                <li>
                    If they touch a unit with one finger, then move their finger elsewhere and lift it, that unit will move to the location where the touch
                    ended.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If their finger passes over other units before they release it, they, too, will move to the target location, standing nicely spaced out in a grid
                    formation.
                </li>
                <li>Eventually, there will be an area in one corner of the screen such that, if the player lifts their finger there, the move order will be cancelled.</li>
                <li>Once enemy units are added, if the player releases their finger over an enemy, an attack order will be issued instead.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Here is a short demo of the controls so far:
            </p>
            <video width="960" height="443" controls>
                <source src="img/rts.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            
                <i>It seems that you are using an old browser that doesn't support video tags. Please click <a href="img/rts.mp4">here</a> to view or download the video.</i>
            </video>
            <p>
                You may notice that towards the end of the video, the units do not take the perfect path, instead opting to move past each other. I have tried to fix
                a few of these situations by generating the grid of positions, and then having each unit move to the nearest available position to them, but this was not
                very effective. I will search for a solution to this issue.
            </p>
            <p>
                To accomodate simple controls and gameplay, in line with the typical "pick up and play" format of mobile games, the tactics will be highly focused on
                macro control (ordering units in big groups, rather than individually; units will not have many activated abilities), and choice of units. I would
                like to use the system of collecting resources to produce units at a certain building that is common in PC RTS games. I will have to do some extensive
                design work to create a game that aligns with my vision.
            </p>
